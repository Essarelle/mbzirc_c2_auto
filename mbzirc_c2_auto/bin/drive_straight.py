"""autonomous.py - Version 1.0 2016-10-12
General framework based on Patrick Goebel's nav_test.py
Initial version based on ccam-navigation by Chris Mobley
Autonomous movement added by Jonathan Hodges
This code moves a mobile base along a waypoint based search routine while
looking for an object. Once an object is detected, the search routine is
cancelled and the mobile base moves toward the object instead.
Dependencies:
    mbzirc_c2_auto/params/pre-defined-path.txt - Waypoints for search routine
Subscribers:
    /detection: array containing [angle,distance] to the median of
        the detected object in local coordinates. Contains [0,0] if no object
        is detected.
Publishers:
    /cmd_vel: topic to manually move the robot
    /move_base/goal: goal sent to the move_base node in ROS
